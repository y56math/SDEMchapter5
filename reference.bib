	abstract = {The main aim of this article is to give an exposition of weak convergence, Prohorov theorem and Prohorov spaces. In this context we study the relationship between Levy distance \${\textbackslash}ell(F, G)\$ between two distribution functions \$F\$ and \$G\$ and the Prohorov distance \${\textbackslash}pi( {\textbackslash}mu, {\textbackslash}nu)\$ between the probability measures \${\textbackslash}mu\$ and \${\textbackslash}nu\$ determined by \$F\$ and \$G\$ respectively. We study the relationship among the weak convergence of probability measures (\${\textbackslash}mu\_n\$) determined by distribution functions (\$F\_n\$) to the probability measure \${\textbackslash}mu\$ determined by a distribution function \$G\$, the convergence of \${\textbackslash}ell(F\_n, G)\$ and \${\textbackslash}pi( {\textbackslash}mu\_n, {\textbackslash}nu)\$ to zero under suitable assumptions on the metric space on which these measures are defined. Tightness of probability measures and relative sequential compactness are studied and Prohorov theorem is proved in different settings. Prohorov spaces and non-Prohorov spaces are discussed.},

	abstract = {Fortet-Mourier (FM) probability metrics are important probability metrics, which have been widely adopted in the quantitative stability analysis of stochastic programming problems. In this study, we contribute to different types of convergence assertions between a probability distribution and its empirical distribution when the deviation is measured by FM metrics and consider their applications in stochastic optimization. We first establish the quantitative relation between FM metrics and Wasserstein metrics. After that, we derive the non-asymptotic moment estimate, asymptotic convergence, and non-asymptotic concentration estimate for FM metrics, which supplement the existing results. Finally, we apply the derived results to four kinds of stochastic optimization problems, which either extend the present results to more general cases or provide alternative avenues. All these discussions demonstrate the motivation as well as the significance of our study.},

The subjects range from basic Hilbert and Banach spaces, through weak topologies and Banach algebras, to the theory of semigroups of bounded linear operators.
